# OakwoodDash (Starter)

This is a ready-to-deploy Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind starter for Netlify.

## Quick Start (with Netlify)

1. Upload this folder to a **GitHub** repo (drag-and-drop on the GitHub website).
2. In **Netlify**: Add new site → Import from Git → choose your repo.
3. Build command: `npm ci && npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `dist`
5. Deploy!

Then open `src/App.tsx` and paste your OakwoodDash component from ChatGPT.
Commit the change to GitHub and Netlify will redeploy automatically.
